    <p>I've worn a number of hats in my 51 years on this planet.

          with my wife, Kelly, of 29 years. </li>
        <li>Race Director. Our fundraiser for KSF is the coolest race in the history of mankind. Unleashed at Stadium Bowl is a race up and down the stairs at the infamous Stadium High School in Tacoma, WA.</li>

      </ol>
      <p> Kelly and I live in Lakewood, WA. Kelly is the ED of KSF, and I own GRIT360, a business services consulting company. My current focus is to help Veterans and mil spouses find work. 
      </p>

        <p> I joined the Army after a pathetic year at Modesto Junior College. I was doing my very best to live like Jeff Spicoli, without surfing.
