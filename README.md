## About Me

This lab is creating some content about me, but learning to code with familiar content. This is harder than it looks.

### Reflections and Comments

* So Jamison and I worked a lot together. I stayed by myself to get the initial part of question 6, then needed some help. Quen and Jamison helped a lot.

* Ryan and Norton--and Brad from 102 are simply terrific instructors. Patience is their watchword. Ryan is great about making me think before giving me an answer. It hurts, but it is beneficial. 

* I can feel how this didn't totally stick yet today. It will likely be another day or two/three before I begin to feel somewhat comfortable with these loops. I will have erotic dreams about the explanation point! What a beautiful symbol--that SAVED me to get out of both loops for questions 6 and 7.
